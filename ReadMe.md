# MercuriusLite: A Lightweight Quantitative Investment System

MercuriusLite is a self-built quantitative investment system focused on asset allocation of macro asset classes in personal investment portfolio. 
It provides some objective guidance for Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy for your own reference. 
MercuriusLite is a lightweight version of my previous project [mercurius](https://github.com/lzhenn/mercurius), of which the development was discontinued.
